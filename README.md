# ABAP Code templates

Folder `templates` contains ABAP Code Templates. One per file. Install them by editing the following file:
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\SAP\SAP GUI\ABAP Editor\abap_user.xml` or by adding them using the ABAP Code editor.

To avoid naming collisions the following file nomenclature should be used:
`<name_in_lowercase>_x` where x is a number. For example, if there are multiple templates with the key `single` distinguish them by
appending `_x`. For example, `single_1`, `single_2`. Each person is free to install the ones they think are useful.

Each file should have a comment in the first line explaining what the code template is for.

Please feel free to contribute.

Thanks!
